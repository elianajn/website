    Skipped into Data Structures and Algorithims as a first year student, completing my major course work on an accelerated track. 
    Colorado College is a selective liberal arts school that operates on the Block Plan, meaning we take one class at a time for an intense three and a half weeks. I feel that learning how to balance my school work, part time jobs, and activites has taught me to manage my time and work efficently under strict deadline.      

    I spend some of my free time with *Women in STEM* and *Girls Skate Club*.
#   During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

#    I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
