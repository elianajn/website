  My name is Eliana, though I often go by Ella, and I'm a computer science student from Chicago and based out of Colorado Springs.
  I'm a third year student at Colorado College, but have been into coding for a good chunk of my life.
#  Hi, my name's Brett and I'm a senior network system administrator. As well as administrating systems I also have experience making software and web apps. I have worked at a number of companies gaining teamwork and leadership skills.

#  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

  Alongside my interests in computer science I love doing outdoor sports, including cycling (with two national podium finishes and ten State/Regional Championships in Cyclocross, Track, and Road),
  climbing, skiing, and hiking.

  I also enjoy textile crafting, such as sewing, crocheting, and cross stitching. I recently crocheted a chalk bag, and have had some of my cross stitching work
  displayed in the Chicago Cultural Center. I consider music and dancing to be life's greatest joys, and cannot wait for the day live music becomes part of
  normal daily life again.
