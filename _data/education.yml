    Skipped into Data Structures and Algorithims as a first year student, completing my major course work on an accelerated track, including my senior thesis a year early.
    Colorado College is a selective liberal arts school that operates on the Block Plan, meaning we take one class at a time for an intense three and a half weeks. I feel that learning how to balance my school work, part time jobs, and activites has taught me to manage my time and work efficently under strict deadline.
    I am on the Dean's List and am a recipient of the Colorado College Scholar and Trustee merit scholarships.


    I work as an undergrad TA, grading and tutoring low-mid level classes. I hold daily office hours, offer work sessions, and work with students by appointment to provide assistance beyond the professors.
    I also work at the school tutoring center for drop-in math and computer science tutoring, and work with individual tutees for the duration of a block for more hands-on assistance. In the pandemic this
    means tutoring via Zoom, which actually works quite while in programming classes (though I do miss whiteboards). I additionally work as a student technician in the Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
    lab, where I assist students, professors, or entire classes with GIS projects using Esri tools such as ArcMap. I also work on specific projects and do a lot of data scraping for seniors working on their theses.
    I've made a few story maps of my own, and [this one](https://ccgisonline.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=681f4a8ab30b4bff8062fdcc4a757c67) is my favorite.


    I spend some of my free time with *Women in STEM* and *Colorado College Climbers Association*.

    I studied abroad in Budapest, Hungary at a school within the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Budapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem).
    Hungary is home to a number of remarkable computer scientists and mathematicians and Budapest is a bustling city rich with history. There I took classes
    in Hungarian language, computer graphics, scalable systems and development processes, 3D design, and Budapest studies. Unfortunately the Coronavirus pandemic
    cut my time there short, but I continued to take classes online through the remainder of the semester (*with* the seven hour time difference).

#   During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

#    I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
